Welcome to Braden's Calculator!

This Calculator works as you expect it should.

I added some additional functionality for recursion/exponentiation. If the user 
chooses to put in input like 2 += , which will result in 2 + 2 = 4. If the user continues 
to press the "=" button, they will get the powers of 2, such as 4,8,16,32,64...etc.

Also note that the Calculator will allow you to additionally add, subtract, multiply and divi-
de numbers continually. It does not reset unless you Clear, or start inputting 2 new inputs.
